# Sony Playstaion 3 XMB Inspired Web Dev Portfolio

This PS3 XMB Portfolio is a visually nostaglic, interactive web application inspired by the iconic PlayStation 3 XMB (Cross Media Bar) interface. This project is built with React, Next and TypeScript, and aims to recreate the nostalgic look and feel of the PS3 dashboard while serving as a personal portfolio and multimedia showcase. Users can navigate through categories such as Projects, Photos, Music, and Videos using keyboard or mouse, and enjoy a seamless, console-like experience. The application features a custom media player for both video and audio, animated disc icons, and a dynamic data-driven menu system, making it both a technical demo and a fun, immersive way to present your work or media collection.
